# **Pima Indians Heritage Diabetes - Hypothesis Testing Port Folio Project**  

This notebook presents a statistical exploration of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains medical and demographic information for female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and older, with a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

The primary objective of this analysis is to apply hypothesis testing techniques to investigate whether certain health indicators and demographic features differ significantly between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This approach not only supports data-driven insights but also demonstrates the application of statistical rigor in real-world health data.  

Goals of the Analysis
The aim is to test the following null hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., t-tests, Mann–Whitney U tests, chi-square tests):

- Glucose Levels H₀: BMI does not significantly differ between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
- Age H₀: There is no difference in average glucose levels between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
- Body Mass Index (BMI) H₀: Age is not associated with diabetes outcome.
- Pregnancies H₀: The number of pregnancies does not affect diabetes likelihood.
- Blood Pressure H₀: Blood pressure does not significantly differ between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
- Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) H₀: DPF does not significantly differ between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

Each hypothesis will be tested using a combination of exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical inference, with clear annotations to guide interpretation and highlight key findings. 

## Data: 
The 'dataset' was taken from Kaggle which was suppose to be used for machine learning project but used the training data set for data Visualization.

## Conclusion: 
The features mentioned above effect the likelihood of contracting diabetes
